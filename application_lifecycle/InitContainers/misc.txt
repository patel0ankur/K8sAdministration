In a multi-container pod, each container is expected to run a process that stays alive as long as the POD's lifecycle.
If any of the container fails, the POD restarts.

If the process that waits for other service to start before actual application starts is called initContainers.

We can run multiple initContainers, but one at a time in sequential order. If can of the initContainers fails, the pod will restart
repeatedly until the initContainers succedds.
